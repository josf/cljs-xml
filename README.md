# cljs-xml

A simple Clojurescript lib that one day will mimick data.xml.

## Overview

This (totally experimental and barely a proof-of-concept) little
library is an attempt to write something like
[clojure.data.xml](https://github.com/clojure/data.xml) that will work
in the browser. `data.xml` relies on Java's xml processing tools. This
lib uses the browser's DOM APIs to parse documents.
